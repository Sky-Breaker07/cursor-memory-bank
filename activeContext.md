# Active Context

## Current System Focus
This is a custom AI chatbot API that uses a conversational RAG architecture to provide intelligent responses to user queries. The system integrates Express.js, MongoDB vector search, and OpenAI LLMs through LangChain.

## Key System Components
1. **Express API Server**: Handles HTTP requests and serves responses
2. **LangChain StateGraph**: Orchestrates the conversation flow through a series of steps
3. **MongoDB Vector Store**: Stores documents and enables similarity search
4. **Session Management**: Maintains conversation history across interactions
5. **Analytics Tracking**: Logs interactions and performance metrics

## Implementation Details
The system follows a graph-based workflow:
1. **Categorization**: Identifies the type of question
2. **Retrieval**: Fetches relevant documents from MongoDB
3. **Generation**: Creates an answer using context and conversation history
4. **Validation**: Checks answer quality and determines if refinement is needed
5. **Refinement**: Improves answer quality if necessary
6. **Human Assistance**: Offers handoff for queries beyond AI capabilities

## Current Status
The system has been implemented with core functionality:
- API endpoint for chat interactions
- MongoDB vector search integration
- LangChain graph-based conversation flow
- Session management for conversation history
- Error handling and analytics tracking

## Next Steps
Potential areas for enhancement:
- Implement streaming responses
- Add more robust testing
- Improve document reordering and relevance scoring
- Enhance human handoff mechanisms
- Optimize token usage and response times
