# System Patterns

## Architectural Patterns
1. **Graph-Based Processing Pipeline**
   - Uses LangChain's StateGraph for orchestrating the conversation flow
   - Enables conditional branching based on answer quality and context relevance
   - Maintains state across processing steps

2. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
   - Combines document retrieval with LLM generation
   - Uses vector search to find relevant context
   - Enhances responses with specific knowledge from the database

3. **Session Management**
   - Maintains conversation history across interactions
   - Uses UUID-based session identifiers
   - Provides formatted history for context-aware responses

4. **Error Handling and Fallbacks**
   - Graceful handling of database and API errors
   - In-memory filtering as a fallback for vector search issues
   - Human handoff for queries requiring expert assistance

## Code Organization
- **Controller Layer**: Handles HTTP requests and responses
- **Service Layer**: Implements business logic and orchestrates operations
- **Data Layer**: Manages database interactions and document storage
- **Utility Layer**: Provides helper functions for various components

## API Design
- RESTful API with JSON request/response format
- Single POST endpoint for chat interactions
- Versioned API path (/api/v1/chat)
- Comprehensive error handling and status codes

## Optimization Techniques
- In-memory document reordering by relevance
- Category-based filtering to improve context quality
- Answer validation and refinement pipeline
- Analytics tracking for performance monitoring

## Core Architectural Patterns

### 1. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
The primary pattern used in this application is RAG, which:
- Enhances LLM responses with retrieved information from a knowledge base
- Reduces hallucinations by grounding responses in factual data
- Provides domain-specific knowledge without fine-tuning the base model

### 2. Layered Architecture
The application follows a standard layered architecture:
- **Route Layer**: Handles HTTP routing (`src/routes`)
- **Controller Layer**: Manages request/response lifecycle (`src/controller`)
- **Service Layer**: Contains business logic (`src/api`)
- **Data Layer**: Manages data access and persistence (`src/db`)

### 3. State Graph Pattern
Using LangChain's StateGraph to manage the flow of:
- Input state (user question)
- Processing state (retrieval and context formation)
- Output state (generated answer)

## Data Flow Patterns

### 1. Document Processing Pipeline
```
DOCX Files → Text Extraction → Chunking → Embedding → Vector Storage
```

### 2. Query Processing Pipeline
```
User Query → API → Embedding → Vector Search → Context Assembly → LLM Generation → Response
```

## Design Patterns

### 1. Dependency Injection
- Configuration variables injected via environment variables
- Services composed at initialization time

### 2. Factory Pattern
- Database connections created via factory methods
- Vector store instances created with appropriate configurations

### 3. Middleware Pattern
- Express middleware for request processing
- Error handling middleware for consistent error responses

## Integration Patterns

### 1. API Gateway
- Express server acting as an API gateway
- Single endpoint exposing the chatbot functionality

### 2. External Service Integration
- MongoDB Atlas for vector storage
- OpenAI for embeddings and language model

## Operational Patterns

### 1. Environment-based Configuration
- Application configured via environment variables
- Different settings for development vs. production

### 2. Seeding Pattern
- Initial data loaded via a seeding script
- Document processing happens outside the main application flow
