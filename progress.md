# Development Progress

## Completed Components
- [x] Express.js API setup with route structure
- [x] MongoDB Atlas Vector Search integration
- [x] LangChain state graph implementation
- [x] OpenAI integration for LLM and embeddings
- [x] Session management for conversation history
- [x] Error handling and graceful fallbacks
- [x] Analytics tracking for system monitoring

## In Progress
- [ ] Performance optimization for vector search
- [ ] Enhanced document relevance scoring
- [ ] Improved answer quality validation

## Future Enhancements
- [ ] Streaming response implementation
- [ ] Automated testing framework
- [ ] Admin dashboard for monitoring
- [ ] Additional data sources integration
- [ ] Fine-tuned domain models
- [ ] Multi-modal input handling (images, audio)

## Key Milestones
1. ‚úÖ **Core API Implementation**: Base Express.js server with API endpoints
2. ‚úÖ **MongoDB Integration**: Vector store and document retrieval
3. ‚úÖ **RAG Pipeline**: Complete conversation flow with categorization and refinement
4. ‚úÖ **Session Management**: User session tracking with conversation history
5. ‚úÖ **Error Handling**: Robust error management and recovery mechanisms
6. ‚è≥ **Performance Optimization**: Improving response time and relevance
7. ‚è≥ **Extended Features**: Adding additional capabilities and integrations

## Known Issues
- MongoDB filtering occasionally fails with certain query structures
- Token limit constraints with very long conversation histories
- Category identification can misclassify complex queries
